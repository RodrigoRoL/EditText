# EditText

## Description

The following project is a text editor where the user can create notes online or offline and where the user can retrieve these notes for a future use. This projects includes a service worker and a cache to make sure ensure that the app remains functional without an active internet connection. With this app users can access the information even if they are offline. This with the help of an IndexedDB database, which allows us to get and store data. Further, with webpack plugins we can generate an HTML file, the service worker, and a manifest file which can be seen when inspecting the application.
